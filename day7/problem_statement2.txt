Employee Salary System Using Inheritance:
=========================================
1. Define a base class named "Employee":

Attributes:
name (string)
id (int)
baseSalary (float)

Constructor(protected):
=======================
* to initialize the instance variables.

Functions(protected):
calculateSalary() → prints base salary only.
display() → prints name, id, and salary (by calling calculateSalary()).

2. Create a derived class "Manager":
Additional attribute(private): bonus (float)
Constructor:
============
Create Constructor and call the Parent Constructor by passing parameters and initialize the remaining attributes.

Override calculateSalary() → salary = baseSalary + bonus
Override display() → prints name, id, and total salary

3. Create a derived class "Developer":
Additional attribute(private): overtimePay (float)

Constructor:
============
Create Constructor and call the Parent Constructor by passing parameters and initialize the remaining attributes.

Override calculateSalary() → salary = baseSalary + overtimePay
Override display() → prints name, id, and total salary

4. In the main() function:
Create one Manager and one Developer object using hardcoded values.
Call their respective display() methods to show full details and computed salaries.
