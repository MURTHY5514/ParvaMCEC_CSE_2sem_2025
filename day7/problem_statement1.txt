1. Shape Area Calculator Using Inheritance:
===========================================
Create a base class named "Shape"
Include a method named calculateArea() that outputs a general message like:
"Area not defined for generic shape."

2. Create the following derived classes:
Circle:
=======
Data member(private): radius
Override calculateArea() to compute area using π × radius²

Rectangle:
==========
Data members(private): length, width
Override calculateArea() to compute area using length × width

Triangle:
=========
Data members(private): base, height
Override calculateArea() to compute area using 0.5 × base × height

3. Constructor(public):
Each derived class must include a constructor to initialize its data members.

4. In the main() function:
Create one object of each shape.
Call their calculateArea() method to print the area.
